   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PyWit's documentation!
=================================

PyWit provides bindings to Wit's HTTP API.

It's easy to get started!

Firstly, work out :doc:`installation <installation>` works.

Next take a look at some :doc:`usage examples <usage_examples>`.

By then, you'll be ready to read the :doc:`API <api>` guide.

Of course, for specifics about the Wit API, you'll need to consult their excellent `documentation <https://wit.ai/docs>`_.

Have fun.
