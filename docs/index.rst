Welcome to PyWit's documentation!
=================================

PyWit provides bindings to Wit's HTTP API.

It's easy to get started.

Firstly, work out how to :doc:`install <installation>` it. Next take a look at some :doc:`usage <usage>` examples.

By then, you'll be ready to read the :doc:`API Guide <api>`.

Of course, for specifics about the Wit API, you'll need to consult their excellent `documentation <https://wit.ai/docs>`_.
